#HOW TO COMPILE
#By N.UTSUMI

#---- for read_DB_files_Nobuyuki.c ---
gcc -fpack-struct FILE.c -lm -o OUTNAME
# "-lm" option is requred for math.h
# "-lm" should be placed after source file

#---- for retrieval code ---
gcc -fpack-struct FILE.c -L/usr/local/lib -lnetcdf -lm -I/usr/local/include -o OUTNAME
# "-lnetcdf" and "-lm" options is requred for netcdf and math.h
# IMPORTANT!!: link options ("-netcdf" and "-lm") should be placed after source file
# (Not know the reason ..)
